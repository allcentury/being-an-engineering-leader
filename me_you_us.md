# Me

I've made this document as a way for you to see and hear my thought processes while we work together.  New team members and leaders always come in with new perspectives (see [smell test](#smell-test)) and I've done my best to lay out who I am, what I care about and how I hope to act.  If you see me violating any of this, please [call me out](#feedback-for-me).

First and foremost, I am a person.  I try my best in most situations but I am fallible and you are too.  Sometimes I ask too much of myself and sometimes I might ask too much of you - I promise it comes from a good place but let's work together to set goals and boundaries that are achievable and desired.

I am also a husband and a father.  My family means the world to me.  My son was desperate to fly his new kite that he got for his birthday and finally the wind picked up at 3pm on a Thursday.  You bet your bottom dollar I kindly asked if we could reschedule my 3pm-4pm meeting, raced down to the park and helped to put that shark kite 50ft into the sky.  I will always prioritize my family over everything else and you should too.  I am sympathetic to the complications of what it means to be an active part of a family or a community (friends, neighbors, religions groups, etc).  Let's talk about this so I can be in tune with your own situation.

## <a name='feedback-for-me'> Feedback</a>

I love feedback.  Good, bad, unsure - send it over. My preference for feedback is in realtime either in a slack DM or verbally.  Your feedback is confidential and I will engage with you on how to address it so we can both move forward.


# You

## Your Career

As a manager my job is to help give you the career you want.  You're hopefully here for reasons of your choosing (you're in an in demand field, I haven't forgotten that) and so I want to acknowledge that your motivations, while evolving, are hopefully inline with where the company is heading.  Note that I wrote company and not team.  Teams, products and work come and go but if you're excited about the company and the mission, you find yourself adaptable and excitable even with underlying change.

### 1:1's

We'll have 1 on 1's for 30 minutes every 1-2 weeks (your preference) where this time is totally focused on you.  We can talk about whatever you want - did your cat keep you up all night?  are you worried about your health? your visa? your career? I am here to listen (and I'm pretty good at it).

#### Score

One of the first questions, I'll ask is on a scale of 1-10 - how are you doing this week? Any answer is appropriate it here.

#### Feedback

During our first few sessions I will ask how you like to receive feedback.  First tell me if you prefer async or sync feedback and how you want it delivered, verbally or in writing. In my view the sooner I can give feedback the better, but I've managed some folks who prefer to wait until the weekly 1:1's.  I'm flexible here.  Feedback is a great way for me to help you grow further both personally and progressionally, while also giving you more self awareness.

I have a format I like to follow for our 1:1's but I'm open to tailoring it to your needs.  First, you and I share 1 doc (it's in the cal invite) and during the week you and I are both adding to it.  Example:


> ~~~~
> metadata heading
> feedback preference: realtime via chat dm
> current technical goal: test container cold starts on lambda's
> current personal goal: 1-2 conference talk submissions re: database optimizations
> ~~~~
> 10/28
>
> Topics:
>  1. Last weeks incident
>  1. Mentoring
>  1. PTO
>  1. Career growth ideas

--------

The metadata section is a place for both of us to set high level goals that span many 1:1's.  The list is your chance (and mine) to add things during the week as they come up - I would prefer you order them so we spend time talking about the most meaningful things to you first.

After we go through the list, I want to cover 2 topics that are vital to your long term success - growing yourself and your career.  To do that, I'll ask you to come up with 3-6 month goals for personal and technical growth.


#### Personal Growth

You are not the same person you were 6 months ago, never mind 6 years ago.  A lot of that was likely due to the different environments you were in.  In this environment we're in together, I want you to be intentional with your own growth.  Examples of goals in this area include things like public speaking (conference talks), presentation skills (influencing other engineers, biz folks, product), oral communication, written communication, mental and physical wellness, etc.

The best personal growth opportunities are ones that benefit you, the team and the business (not always in that order).  Set real goals, that can be measured.

##### Good examples of achievable goals:

* I want to submit an idea for a conference talk to 3 conferences.

This is a good goal because you don't control whether your talk gets chosen but you do control the submission.  The team and I can help you refine this to increase your chances.

* I want to host 2 retros this quarter to help with my oral communication.

Sold!


##### Poor examples of achievable goals:

* I want to get better at written communication.
* I want to feel less stressed at work.

Those are poor because the outcome is subjective and immeasurable.  If they are immeasurable that means I can't be your accountability-buddy and we'll do circles around your growth. You could tighten those up like so:

* I want to get better at written communication by submitting 3 [RFC](#request-for-comments-(rfc))'s in the next 6 months.
* I want to feel less stressed at work, so I plan to exercise 3 mornings during the work week.

#### Technical Growth

You got into this field because you love technology, not necessarily to help your aunt and uncles when their internet is "slow".  Was that example also too close to home for you?

Good examples of achievable goals:

1. I want to try out CockroachDB as an alternative to PostgreSQL and present my finds back to the team by the end of Q2.
1. I want to test AWS Lambda on our async batch processing to see if it scales better and/or is more cost efficient.  I'll write up a report back to the team with my findings.

Poor examples of achievable goals:

1. I want to learn rust.
1. I want to learn about good architecture.

Those last examples are immeasurable and vague.  Learning rust is a great idea but because it can't be measured, I would come back and say, 'why don't you try to learn rust while doing the [advent of code for 2020](https://adventofcode.com/)'.  I can be your accountability buddy by looking at what you've solved and ask about what you've learned.

For the "learn good architecture" goal, I'd suggest finding an open source project that is thought to have good architecture (k8s, ruby on rails, react) - take a portion of it, try and learn it and present back to the team patterns you saw.

## Craft vs Greenfield

In management I think a lot about what engineers care about, what their interests are and what they value.  Those topics are vast but I've settled on the idea of a two sided spectrum.  On the left side of the spectrum is craft and on the other end of the spectrum is greenfield.  Let's look at these in better detail:

#### Craft

Craft engineers love to build highly reliable, well architected systems.  They look at dashboards showing throughput and latency for fun and long to squeeze out every inch of the available compute resources whenever possible.  When things are on fire a craft engineer is the person you call and after the fire is out, they already have a dozen ideas of how to prevent the system(s) from having these problems ever again.  If you value principles like great code, highly available systems, test coverage, performance then you likely align with the craft mindset.

#### Greenfield

Greenfield engineers love to build new products and ship those to users.  Their motivation is at its peak when a product person comes down from the user-research mountain top and shares the next big thing that needs to be built.  Shipping new products and features gets a greenfield engineer motivated and at the end of the year when a greenfield engineer reflects on their achievements, the list always starts with the products they've shipped.

#### Identify Where You Are

During your career you will shift and move across this spectrum as will the company and its culture.  I share this because if you know where you are on this spectrum (hard craft, hard greenfield, somewhere in between) it can help you find initiatives, teams and companies that better align with your values.  There is nothing more frustrating than being on a team that only ships new features when all you want to fix is reliability.

For example, you've probably been on a team where you worked really hard on new products, then out of desperation due to a recent incident, finally a sprint was carved out to deal with tech debt.  This is a greenfield team acknowledging that it can't ship new features indefinitely because craft will suffer, however, craft already suffered and worse, customers saw it.  Going from one end of the spectrum to another then back then forth in quick succession can be exhausting for you as an engineer.

#### Ideas

* I've found the best teams have a balance but that a team with awareness of where they are on the spectrum have the best results.
* Tell me where you are in this spectrum today and I'll work with you to find common ground.
* I will always do my best to showcase where the team should be on the spectrum for a given sprint.
* Major projects should start as greenfield and end with craft (sometimes you have to go craft -> greenfield -> craft).

Anecdotally I've bounced to each side of the spectrum about every 2 years.  When I was an IC there were some years I only cared about shipping new features and other times I only wanted to make those systems hum.

##### Big Picture

You gain new users with new products but you __keep__ those users with a focus on craft - I'll explain this to product managers and engineering leaders until my last breath.




# Us

## Trade Offs

> “Give me a one-handed economist.  All my economists say, ‘on the one hand...', then, 'but on the other...'” - Harry Truman

I view engineering as a series of trade-offs.  Trade-offs, by definition implies that there's more than one answer but to me, some questions only have one answer.  For example, if you ask me whether to ship now and test later or test now and ship later, I will always answer that we should test now.  Some answers like this are automatic but most answers start with 'it depends...'

### One-sided answers

* Automation over process
* Nonfunctional requirements must be defined inline with their corresponding functional requirements

### Multi-sided answers

#### Request for Comments (RFC)

One of the ways I get a glimpse into your thought process is around your ability to foresee and communicate trade-offs.  For engineering decisions I've found using an RFC(Request For Comments) process that forces you and the team to talk about a problem with multiple solutions, works best.  These documents give you the chance to share the problem, the solutions you are thinking about while also allowing the team to contribute.  It's also the best way I've found to build consensus, share knowledge and challenge each other to do the right long term thing on behalf of the customer and the team.  We won't reach consensus every time - see [decision making](#decision-making) when we're stuck.

Once an RFC has been drafted and the team has move forward with a solution, we have 2 goals - one short term and another medium term.  In the short term, whether you agreed with the chosen path or not, we have to come together and commit to the solution and to the team.  We all make hard choices and sometimes it can feel difficult to move forward with a solution you didn't think was our best option.  My ask is that you remain open to what the team selected and help the team see it through.  If after some time, we find ourselves running into problems due to the solution we chose and we need to pivot, we'll create something called an Architecture Decision Log (ADL).

ADL's are a way for us to capture architecture outcomes.  Examples of ADL's are when we abandon a technology in favor of another, or when we move from one pattern to another (ie synchronous to asynchronous).  ADL's answer questions for new teammates that typically come up during their own smell test.  Questions like, "why did we chose X over Y?" or "did we knowingly cut this corner?".  ADL's share the context of big decisions that effect the entire team along with empowering newcomers to propose new ideas and solutions by using historical context.

## Engineering Best Practices

### Deployments

When something breaks in production, my first question is almost always `what changed?`. I've asked this question enough that I know rolling out code is the riskiest activity we do as engineers and I have a couple of hard and fast rules that have influenced my thoughts on deployments:

#### Always Rollback (ARB)

Every deploy should be reversible.  When something breaks we should always rollback.  I know there are situations where we can't (for example rolling back a database upgrade is sometimes impossible).

#### Progressive Delivery is a Flock of Canaries

[Progressive delivery][argo] is a great way to rollout code safely while also making sure rollbacks are 1st class citizens.  You can only do progressive delivery if your deployments are reversible.

##### Rolling Forward

It is common to want to roll forward to put out a fire but in a CI/CD/GitOps world a roll forward can take build and release time and I am usually adamant that tests are run before a deploy.  Please avoid rolling forward in a crisis but if it has to be done, ensure the test suite passes.


## Smell Test

When you first step foot in someones house, you always notice the smell - good, bad or indifferent.  Over time though, the more you go to that house, the less the smell catches your attention until eventually it becomes normal to you.

When you join a new team or a new company, in those first 90 days, I promise you will notice some smells.  For example, when I joined Braintree I noticed we did weekly releases via manual deploy checklists but I had just come from a company that did GitOps - this was a smell.  I encourage everyone that joins our teams to write down those smells and present them either to me or back to the team.  I'd prefer the latter but that assumes we have built up [psychological safety](#pyschological-safety).

## Project Aristotle

In 2012 Google's research was [informally published][project-aristotle-nyt] on what made some teams so much more successful than others.  They've since created more on the topic in [re:Work][project-aristotle]. There are 3 big takeaways, each of which I want to embrace on the team:

### Clear Goals

You should know exactly how the work you do on your team contributes to our company's mission.  There should be no mental gymnastics needed here.

### Culture of Dependability

Teammates need to *trust* that you are going to do what you said you would.  When trust breaks within a team and others pick up the slack, we have violated this principle.

### Psychological Safety

>  ... to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can’t be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.

Team members feel safe to take risks, speak their mind and be vulnerable in front of one another.

## Leveling Up and Expectations

One of the hardest and most complicated areas regarding your career are your own expectations and where that intersects with your companies expectations.  PayPal has the [Step Up Guide](https://go/stepup) which is a great guide to help you think about what you're great at and where you need to improve.  In addition to that guide, here is where I stand on high performers and level expectations.

### High Performers at the Senior+ Level

High performers deliver with autonomy, clarity and efficiency.  You see trade-offs a mile away and offer up solutions for both short term and long term perspectives.  You understand the business risks associated with all solutions and have no problems communicating to technical and non-technical stakeholders alike.

You take ownership of projects, code and mentees.  Did a bug of yours make it to production?  You own it.  Did your mentee create a bug?  You own it.  Is a project going to miss a deadline?  You've informed me well in advance and you own it.

Owning it can mean different things in different context but let's take an example:

#### Your Mentee Shipped A Bug

Your mentee just shipped a bug and we're talking about it in our 1/1:

>Me:  Let's talk about Incident-123.
>
>You: Thanks for bringing this up.  The code that broke production came from the project we were both working on.  I missed the problem during code review and we clearly missed some automated tests to go along with it.  I've chatted with mentee about it, we talked about how to tighten up future code changes and what tests are needed for a feature to be shipped.  If there's more to share with the rest of the team we'll present that at our next retro.

Breaking that down:

1. You took ownership for a mistake that wasn't directly yours
1. You showed me your dove into the problem enough to know what went wrong
1. You have ideas on solutions
1. You're accountable to the rest of the team

By having this mindset and accountability you will create such a positive impact on your mentee and your team.  I promise that for any teams I am part of, failing is never a blame game.  Owners feel that blame without it being directed towards them but bugs are not one persons fault - we all have to be active and vigilant to raise the bar and ship higher quality products.
