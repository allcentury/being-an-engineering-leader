# Hi.

This repo is my attempt to codify my own set of management principles.  It is a living document because I am constantly learning and adapting.
You are welcome to use these ideas, concepts and ideals (many of them are already taken from others).

Managing is hard.  People, companies and organizations are wildly complicated and trying to put them in some series of clean boxes or categories is a trap. Instead my goal here is find generalized concepts and practical processes to adopt them based on my current role and responsibilities.

Happy to chat or take feedback on any of this.
